Mandatory,good,average,good,0,27246867,0,,awesome,5,DLS2101,Jeremie is my favourite prof. He's very kind and his lectures are more like conversations with the students.  I love his teaching style as well as his exam format. As long as you listen in class and understand the subject you're sure to do well. He's very approachable and he gets on the same level as his students.
