Unclear about assignments (she also made the two assignments that make up your grade seem easy and then marked extremely hard). When people complained, she didn't seem to care at all; never saw people get so angry with a professor! She also only gave our first mark past the drop date",05/23/2013,5.0,5.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.0,1.0,1,No,1369343171000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

There are 2 essays (worth 30% & 70%) which don't necessarily have much to do with what is taught. She just tells stories and teaches new things 20% of the time. Tough grader for the papers. I learned nothing taking this class. Class is VERY boring at times.",03/22/2013,2.0,2.0,,3,It's my life,3.5,3.5,1,No,1363974362000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
