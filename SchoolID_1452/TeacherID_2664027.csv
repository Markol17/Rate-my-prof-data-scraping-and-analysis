He is everything you could hope for in a professor - understanding, kind, honest, straightforward, a great lecturer. He's a PhD student currently, not an official professor, but he is better than 99% of the professors I have ever had. Highly recommend taking his psychopathology course (or ANY other course he's teaching).",01/15/2021,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1610724502000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Caring', 'Respected', 'Inspirational']",people,people

There is a lot of textbook reading, but lectures covered most of the material. There were two assignments which weren't too hard to complete. His recorded lectures were very organized and clear. Easy to contact and super understanding. If you work hard you can get a good grade!",01/12/2021,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1610486474000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Caring', 'Accessible outside class', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
