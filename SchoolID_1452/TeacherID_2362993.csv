Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,29830546,0,,good,4,CLA2335,Prof Jones was one of the nicest professors I've ever had-- she took the time to get to know every student's name in the whole class. She cared a lot about the material and worked hard to make her students interested in it as well. The lectures were extremely content heavy so make sure you take good notes and supplement them with your own research.,04/18/2018,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1524051026000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
