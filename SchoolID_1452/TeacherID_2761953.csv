He is super accessible outside of class and responds really fast to emails. Can go a bit fast sometimes but even then he is great at re-explaining if you need it. Pretty funny too, all around an enjoyable prof",01/10/2022,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1641785198000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Inspirational', 'Hilarious', 'Caring']",people,people
