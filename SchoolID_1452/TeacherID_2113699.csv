Mandatory,good,good,good,0,36133056,0,online,awesome,5,SOC4303,"Pros: Great prof, super interesting lectures, always available to help students, clear grading criteria. 
Cons: 2 large group projects, mandatory participation mark, lots of readings.
Even if you havent done the readings, just ask questions in class and all will be well participation mark wise.
Overall great prof but need to put in a lil effort. :)",04/22/2022,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,N/A,1650662953000,Yes,0,Yes,,A,"['Participation matters', 'Get ready to read', 'Amazing lectures ']",people,people

Shes also super into in class participation. All that being said its a pretty standard if not repetitive sociology class thats an easy A if you get good group members.,12/13/2021,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1639436046000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Participation matters', 'Group projects', 'Lecture heavy']",people,person

There isn't a crazy amount of work assigned which is nice, and the guest speakers are actually relevant to the material & interesting. Her grading is a bit odd and a little difficult but that's the only negative thing I can think of. I'd recommend this class!",02/28/2016,3.0,3.0,,4,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,No,1456666053000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Respected', 'Gives good feedback']",people,person
