Mandatory,good,good,good,0,35775844,0,online,awesome,5,PSY2110,I gained a lot of insight from this course. I really enjoyed the bit on self-compassion as that I never knew of this concept before. I appreciated that she took the time outside of class to have interesting conversations. The workload was comparable to other online classes.
