Midterm average was a 50 before he curved it but somehow he was very proud of this.. He's very approachable and willing to answer questions but a lot of the time his powerpoints have mistakes in them.,11/15/2017,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1510788213000,No,1452,Yes,,C-,"['Tough grader', 'Test heavy']",people,person
