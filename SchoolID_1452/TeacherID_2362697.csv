Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,29857495,14,,awesome,5,ECO2144,He is probably the most straightforward professor I've ever had. He said he doesn't like cumulative exams and marking so his marking scheme is literally problem sets and 3 multiple choice midterms of equal weight. His teaching is a bit too fast but he tries to maintain pace and makes sure that people can keep up with the lectures. Great prof.,04/21/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1524323449000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,['Clear grading criteria'],people,person

His problem sets that he assigns on the LMS do a good job in preparing you for the examinations. He does a really good job explaining whatever concept you need help with during his office hours.
