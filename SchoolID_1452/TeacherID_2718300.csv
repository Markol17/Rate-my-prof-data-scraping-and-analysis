He doesn't teach in lectures and uses prerecorded videos for &quot;lectures&quot;, there's a lot of reading and you basically teach yourself.

Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,2,35176591,0,,awful,1,CRM1300,This class was a major waste of my time. Only reason I didn't do badly was because I took grade 11 and 12 law and its mostly review. He posted lecture videos and readings (a ton) that you had to watch BEFORE coming to live class. All we did during live lectures was wooclap. Why have a 3 hour lecture slot if we don't do anything?
