She is up-to-date on the newest ethical guidelines in Canada. I had two conferences to present at this term that overlapped, and she was very accommodating. I wish I could write more. Highly recommend! Superb professor and person. +++++",01/12/2018,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1515717565000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Respected', 'Inspirational']",people,people

Beware of getting the debate topic that goes against her personal opinions because if you do a good job arguing for it, you will be scolded in class. Very old school too - teaches ethics using terms like ""Thou shall"" ""Thou must"" and ""Thou may"".
