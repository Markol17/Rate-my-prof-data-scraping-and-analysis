She can be a tough marker, so if you like to slack off she might not be the prof. for you. But if you're going to show up and do the readings, she's great.

N/A,good,good,good,0,34501725,0,online,awesome,5,CRM3335,Brilliant and funny. Clear about what she wants from you. Accessible outside of class with potential for extra credit but will make you work for it. Not easy but doable if you make the effort. Things can get hard and really build up so make sure to ask her for help as shes always willing to guide you if youre stuck in a tight spot.

This was my most difficult and heavy class of the online semester, for a research course which should be much easier. I learned nothing about research, but was required to do hours of readings a week, surprise assignments, a huge exam and an essay.

Lectures used heavy jargon and were difficult to understand without doing all readings (and taking notes on the readings). Participation mandatory for marks and surprise assignments. Professor wanted very specific things within papers without explicitly saying so.
