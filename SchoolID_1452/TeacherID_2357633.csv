The grading criteria are clear, I usually found that my grade reflected the amount of work I put into it.

Don't get me wrong, the material is quite interesting but the exam is hard and she makes you do these assignments that should be worth more than 3.3% each (seriously 5 pages for 3.3%?). She also teaches for 1hr before the midterm",04/05/2018,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1522946612000,No,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Lecture heavy', 'Tough grader']",people,people
