N/A,good,average,good,0,34683846,0,,awesome,5,MAT1322,"Easily accessible outside of lecture time, but I found that I didn't really need it that much. The detailed lecture notes posted after each class were enough to be able to ace the tests and exams, as well as the near-weekly homework assignments. The tests and exams were all very fairly made with few curveballs.

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,34682812,0,online,awesome,5,MAT1322,"Prof. Basiri explained the topics clearly and always made herself available to answer questions, even outside of office hours. The textbook isn't mandatory but certainly useful for practice questions if you want to do well in the class. (These questions cover edge cases that might come up in exams.) I highly recommend her!",05/02/2021,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1619998229000,Yes,1452,Yes,,B+,"['Accessible outside class', 'Gives good feedback', 'Caring']",people,people
