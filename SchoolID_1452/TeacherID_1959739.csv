Not Mandatory,average,average,average,1,26379786,0,,average,2,DVM3160,"Love Nipa as a person, she is easy to approach and has a great sense of humor. The down side is that she's unclear sometimes. Her experience working for CIDA is impressive and she knows a heck of a lot about development however when it comes to teaching, she can get quite confusing. Watch out for group projects, its 50% of your grade.",04/26/2016,2.0,2.0,,3,N/A,2.5,2.5,1,No,1461666163000,N/A,1452,Yes,,A,"['Participation matters', 'Lecture heavy', 'Group projects']",people,person
Mandatory,poor,average,poor,2,25148752,0,,awful,1,DVM3160,She's hands down the worst prof I have had. I mean I got a good grade but not in any way because I worked hard. I only worked hard at trying to decipher what Nipa wanted. Only told us there was a final essay on group work 3 weeks before the end on the term. She gave us constant updates of syllabus so we never knew what she wanted and when. AVOID!!!,08/25/2015,2.0,2.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,No,1440499945000,N/A,1452,Yes,,A,['Group projects'],people,people

Her out of date and narrow perspective on development is made worse by the simple fact she cant remember her own points from one sentence to the next.

However, her class is terribly boring, one-sided (only learn about large scale projects) and her expectations are incredibly unclear. She contradicts herself and is very picky. 60%+ group work.
