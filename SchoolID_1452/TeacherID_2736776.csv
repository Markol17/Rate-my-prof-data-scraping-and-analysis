The content during the lectures weren't simple, but they were interesting, and Professor Karunananthan was able to teach it well. I would most certainly take a class with her again.

No final, just a research proposal that could be completed in a group. She replies to her emails super quick and is very nice and approachable. The labs are pretty easy and actually very useful for future research projects. Definitely recommend.
