May sometime take things personally if people fall asleep in class etc.Very intelligent but teaches first year classes at 3rd year level! and thus tends to give off impression of a hard marker! Very nice and understanding.",06/01/2009,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1243825241000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people
