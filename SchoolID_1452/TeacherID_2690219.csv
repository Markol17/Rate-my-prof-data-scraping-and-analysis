N/A,good,average,good,0,36290768,0,online,awesome,5,MAT1762,"Mat1362 is a very hard class but Professor Fortier-Garceau made it really easy. He is always available outside of class and cares about his students and their success. He provides the necessary material to succeed in ALL assignments and responds to emails at all times, even on weekends. I 100% recommend this Professor to all students.

Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,34618176,0,online,awful,1,MAT1762,"This class was insanely difficult. Class average was around 50%, and that is excluding the many students that dropped out. The prof gives near zero examples during class of what are on the tests, and tends to snicker at students for not understanding. Grading is extremely picky, TA's aren't much help at all. Avoid this guy at all costs.",04/25/2021,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1619337245000,No,1452,Yes,,F,['Tough grader'],people,people
