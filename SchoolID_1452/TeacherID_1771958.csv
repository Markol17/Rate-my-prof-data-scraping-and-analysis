N/A,poor,good,poor,0,21243245,0,,poor,1,PSY2301,Talked/Taught way too fast. Just read the slides instead of elaborating on it. No assignments to make up for bad marks considering its basically a bio course. Do not take this class if you need a prof who explains things well. She asks for feedback but it doesn't even apply to the class - so pointless,01/10/2013,5.0,5.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,1357845722000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

She goes through things fairly fast but there is a lot of things to go through in the class so she kind of has to. You just need to make sure you pay attention and you're good. Her midterms and exams are very fair as well.,12/21/2012,3.0,3.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,No,1356090193000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

Talks very fast and goes through slides quickly. If you read your book though, you're good, as she takes everything out of there for the most part.",11/28/2012,3.0,3.0,,3,It's my life,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1354089242000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
