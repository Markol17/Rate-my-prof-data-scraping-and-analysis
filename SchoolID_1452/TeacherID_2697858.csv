He is a tough grader and expects active participation with your camera on &amp; verbal contribution every class in addition to well thought-out discussion posts (500+ words) every week without fail. Every class is a discussion and he does not teach. Worst part of my week.

Instead, it's all discussion during class between him and mostly the students. If you don't participate, your overall grade will suffer.
