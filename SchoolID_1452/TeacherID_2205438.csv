The midterm is open book, and there are 5 quizzes worth 5% each but she drops your lowest mark. Super easy to do well if you just do the readings before hand. You'll love this class, but I recommend going to her office hours!",12/16/2017,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1513460570000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Beware of pop quizzes', 'Amazing lectures ']",people,people

Lectures were very interesting and relevant, used a mix of videos, discussion, guest lecturers and her own lectures to teach. All readings were online and free as well as being interesting. Did not post slides so attendance was important but not mandatory.
