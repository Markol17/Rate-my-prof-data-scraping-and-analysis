Mandatory,good,good,good,1,35353896,0,online,awesome,5,BIO3350,I don't understand the bad reviews because he was one of the best profs I have ever had. His teaching style is so clear and is also accessible outside class and is very nice. His tests are hard but so was this class. I believe some students wanted this to be a bird course which was impossible. Take notes and listen to his words and you'll do great.,12/03/2021,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1638490422000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Lecture heavy', 'Caring', 'Respected']",people,person
Mandatory,average,good,average,0,34542535,1,online,poor,2,BIO3350,He never replies to emails and teaches pretty arrogantly and condescendingly. He would tell us the kinds of questions he asks and then ask completely different questions on the exam. Definitely my least favourite prof out of the 3350 bunch.,04/13/2021,5.0,5.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1618321035000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Tough grader', 'Lecture heavy', 'Test heavy']",person,people
