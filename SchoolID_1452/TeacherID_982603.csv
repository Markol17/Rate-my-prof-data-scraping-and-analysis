He made me love a class i had no interest in at the start. his midterms focus on a very small portion of what's taught so you do need to memorize everything but study well and go to class and u'll have no problem with the questions he asks. overall one of the best bio profs i've had yet.",11/15/2009,1.0,1.0,,5,Meh,5.0,5.0,1,No,1258311234000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

I disagree that he tests on obscure material, he's very clear on what he'll be putting on the midterm you just HAVE to go to class and study before hand, easily got an A with a little work.
