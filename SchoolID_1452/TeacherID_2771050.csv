Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,36127257,0,,poor,2,PHI-1102,"This class was based only on the midterm 20%, essay 30% and final 50%. His lectures are ok, he gets off topic and can be hard to understand but overall he knows his content. He provides good reviews for the exams. If you study you'll do well, they were never too challenging. So many readings, be prepared to read a LOT.

Great way to engage students and hear different perspectives. There is a lot of reading, which I have personally skimmed through most since it's way too much to read (for someone who has 5 classes). He's open to feedback and is very sympathetic! :) ",04/04/2022,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1649095517000,Yes,0,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Gives good feedback', 'Online Savvy']",people,people
