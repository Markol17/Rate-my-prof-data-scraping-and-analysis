N/A,good,poor,good,0,20373253,0,,good,4,PSY2116,Took him for Stats II and overall it was a good class. If you have a background in stats/did well in Stats I then this class might be pretty basic and mostly review. But his explanations are clear and you have the opportunity to do well. He has a way of making the topic very approachable. Recommend.,06/02/2012,1.0,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1338621716000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
