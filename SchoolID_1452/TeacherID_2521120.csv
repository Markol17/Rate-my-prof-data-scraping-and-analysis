Not Mandatory,average,good,average,0,32866424,0,,poor,2,NSG2317,"Profesor Tzaki makes her exams quite tough. You absolutely need to read the textbook to pass this course, and there is so many chapters to read!! She is not very clear about her expectations, if you ask her a question about things in the textbook she will not answer clearly so don't.

She's nice but unorganized, her lectures are dull but she adds important information to the slides verbally. She assigns so many textbook chapters, and some of the questions are things not covered in her slides.

She would read off her slides and never seemed overly knowledgable on the topics. Would often just tell us to read the textbook instead of explaining material well and giving real life examples.
