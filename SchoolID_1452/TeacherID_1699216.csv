She marked my essay outline and provided me with a DETAILED guideline on how I can make my essay better (even suggesting books, and the pages I can find quotes on).  Also any questions about the essay or test- she is more than willing to answer.",05/30/2012,3.0,3.0,,5,Meh,4.5,4.5,1,No,1338406619000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

Asks critical questions that are ambigous, that require lenghty answers in exams, and  that she herself cannot answer.
