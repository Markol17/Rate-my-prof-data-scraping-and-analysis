Mandatory,average,average,average,0,35684009,0,online,poor,2,MUS3733,He is very knowledgeable and friendly professor. Small essay every week ranges from 1 to 5 pages depending on the week. Is flexible with extensions. This is a class that I feel teaches you more how to research than learning the actual history. It is an interesting class still. The research topics he gives are interesting and he is an easy grader.,01/01/2022,3.0,3.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1641065264000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Accessible outside class', 'Lots of homework', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people

Quite simply the lectures have little impact on the assignments provided in the online format of the class. No tests, just endless papers and meaningless prompts.
