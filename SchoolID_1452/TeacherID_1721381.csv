Cancels tons of classes, is unable to answer questions in class, and conveys the subject matter in a very confusing way. She uses the old version of the text which has slightly different cases and emphases making class very confusing.

N/A,average,average,average,0,20239104,0,,average,3,TORTS1103,Small group. Straight lecture style. Not very helpful syllabus. Focuses on cases in textbook notes as well. Talks relatively fast which is a problem if you don't know which case she's referring to. Heavy readings although Torts is not as complicated as Contracts. Straightforward exams but she curved down as a result. Fair marker. Easy-going.,05/09/2012,2.0,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1336569890000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
