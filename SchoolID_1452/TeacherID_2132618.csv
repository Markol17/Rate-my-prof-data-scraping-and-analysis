There was a ton of reading and the subject matter was heavy to say the least, but I came out with a much deeper respect for literature and much higher aspirations for my academic career. I expected British literature to be a bunch of old white men and this was thoroughly rejected in an awesome way!",05/05/2021,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1620230561000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Inspirational', 'Gives good feedback', 'Amazing lectures ']",people,people

He has always emailed me back within twenty minutes of contacting him, even at 10 pm, and he's extremely helpful and understanding.

On the plus side Mondays were the only night i went to bed before 10:30 because the class put me right to sleep. 0/10 do not take this prof,04/04/2017,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1491348888000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['So many papers', 'Participation matters', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
