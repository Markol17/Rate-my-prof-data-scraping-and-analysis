N/A,good,good,good,3,24971370,0,,awesome,5,POL2104,"This course taught me how to write papers (that will be graded well) at a university level: by focusing on major theories and incorporating them. No textbook, just free readings, but you have to read them(or at least skim)to do well. Shelagh is happy to explain assignments in detail (repeatedly)and give extensions, pretty easy marker too.

N/A,average,average,average,4,24885305,0,,good,3,POL2104, I really did enjoy her course. It is true that she speaks way too fast but her lectures are very interesting. She is very motivated and knows what she is teaching. She gives great feedback and she is always there when you need help.
