N/A,good,average,good,0,15998893,0,,good,4,DRC1503,Very clear & interesting. One of the less academic & more pedagogue profs. Truly interesting classes. Do your reading and listen to him & you'll get a really good grade. However he does sometimes look & speaks like he just got out of a coma and he did all his suit shopping in the 80s-90s so he looks kinda funny at times.,06/28/2009,2.0,2.0,,4,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,1246171680000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

He doesn't speak very fast so at first you might think uh-oh this will be a long semester, but at the end of the 3 hour classes, I didn't want it to stop! He delivers the information clearly, and his exams are VERY easy (if you read the book).",03/02/2008,1.0,1.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1204451997000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
