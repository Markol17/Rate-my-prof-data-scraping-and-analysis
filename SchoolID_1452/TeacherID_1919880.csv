His grading structure also wasn't helpful and he wouldn't give you much feedback unless you spoke to him during his office hours.

Very picky about proper englishgrammar etc. and refuses to post the slides online. Difficult to study off of notes you take in his class, as you don't have time to copy slides AND what he says.
