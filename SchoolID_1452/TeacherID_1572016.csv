The final exam though had nothing to do with what we learned in class. All my studying had gone to waste and my grade dropped from an A+ to A-. To add insult to injury, she refuses to admit it's her fault! Avoid if possible.",06/08/2011,4.0,4.0,,2,Really into it,2.0,2.0,3,Yes,1307529642000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

She said the final would have questions with the same amount of detail as those on the midterm, but it was much more detailed! The final encompassed 16 chapters so it was difficult to prepare for considering the precision of her questions. I would recommend avoiding this teacher.",05/01/2011,4.0,4.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,3,Yes,1304293719000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
