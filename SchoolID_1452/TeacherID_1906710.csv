Mandatory,poor,good,poor,0,24843336,3,,awful,1,NUT2504,"Labs are on Sundays. Teacher is strict. Students are treated like future-chefs-to-be, when this is supposed to be a nutrition class where we should learn how to prepare food for different communities. Instead, the class that was supposed to be 1h30 lasted 30-45 min. The course material that was taught had already been learned in a previous class.

Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,23366792,5,,awful,1,NUT2504,This is a mandatory class for Nutrition and Sabine does her best to make it a living hell. Very unhelpful when asked questions; doesn't know what she's talking about. Her directions for projects were completely useless and unrelated. She is more concerned about her 'reputation' than she is about you actually learning anything.,06/12/2014,5.0,5.0,,1,Meh,1.0,1.0,1,No,1402575709000,N/A,1452,N/A,,B+,[],people,person
