N/A,average,average,average,0,24821779,0,,average,3,MDV2100,"Professor May is a good lecturer but his assignments suck. He considers a C an average grade, so even if you work hard look at only getting a B. Went to see him multiple times during office hours to get help (which was given), but never reflected in the grades I received after following everything I ask. No tests or in-class final though.

He didn't assign readings for the MDV2100 class, so show up. He's a great teacher and an even better person. On the other hand, don't expect to hand in weak papers and pass with flying colors.

The lecture is a 3hr lecture, should have been a 1.5hr twice a week class. The content can be interesting but it can also be EXTREMELY boring. Taking notes can be difficult if you don't have a laptop. No textbook and the final is take home so there's a plus.",11/28/2013,3.0,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.0,3.0,1,No,1385648788000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,22350044,0,,good,4,MDV2100A,I find Prof May to be extremely caring and helpful. He is very intelligent and easy going. The lectures do get boring but you sort of need to sit through them in order to really get all the information. His feedback on assignments is sometimes illegible but if you go to his office hours he is extremely helpful in explaining.

He explains what he wants, you do it, & then he says it is wrong. He repeats himself in his lectures over & over for 3 hours. He takes at least 2 days to reply to an email (better off asking the TA).Very disappointed with this class :(",11/17/2013,4.0,4.0,,1,It's my life,1.0,1.0,1,No,1384697689000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people
