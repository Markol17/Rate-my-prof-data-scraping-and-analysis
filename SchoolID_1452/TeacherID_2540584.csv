Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,36075814,0,,awful,1,SVS2530,This prof had A LOT of breakout rooms and reflection questions. There was rarely time to go over actual lecture notes. I also ended up not going to class in-person with the online option because she called me out for not going 1 day. The final exam did not seem that related to the class. I feel like I didn't learn much and lost interest.,04/14/2022,2.0,2.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,N/A,1649904068000,N/A,0,Yes,,A,['Graded by few things'],people,people
