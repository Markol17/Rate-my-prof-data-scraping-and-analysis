N/A,good,good,good,0,21033299,0,,awesome,4,ADX1,He's a really good professor. Obviously it's statistics so be prepared for tough content. I can only suggest to you to practice daily (treat it like a tough math course) or you're doomed. Open book exams (way harder than you can imagine). Attend the labs!!!
