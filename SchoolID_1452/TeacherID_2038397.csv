Mandatory,good,good,good,0,29124156,1,,awesome,5,DCC3102,"I actually really like Meredith. He stays behind to answer any of your questions and marks reasonably. The course readings are heavy if you actually read every single case but he always summarizes it for you in class. His lecture is structured, so im not sure what the other comments are about. 7-10 is normally a dry class for anyone to attend.",12/10/2017,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1512947603000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Lecture heavy']",person,people
Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,28696583,1,,awful,1,DCC3102,"SUUUUUPER slow lecture, had him for a 7-10 and honestly it was so hard to stay.. majority of the class seemed like him searching for words looking down at his sheets.. his class is made up of assignments worth 40% and the final worth 60% which he makes very clear that it is hard and will take the full 3 hours.. I 10/10 do not recommend this class!",09/25/2017,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1506371622000,No,1452,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Tough grader', 'Lecture heavy']",person,person
