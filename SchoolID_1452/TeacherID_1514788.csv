N/A,poor,average,poor,0,19048085,0,,awful,1,ENG1112,Awful professor. Tests and quizzes seemed random and she seemed to give out random marks rather than follow a specific scheme. She marked my test wrong (forgot to mark and entire section) and I had to bug her every class and office hour for TWO MONTHS for her to change it.

Drones on endlessly on what can be accomplished in a few sentences. Classes quite unpleasant- reminiscent of elementary days and scolding teachers. Marking scheme rather questionable and unreliable.
