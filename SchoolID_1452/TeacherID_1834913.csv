She is SUPER smart which means sometimes she gets going a little quickly, especially since she's so passionate about immunology. Lectures are definitely heavy but it is a 4th year class so it's expected.

She's super intelligent and sometimes forgets that we aren't always keeping up to her speed in lectures. If she asks a question and no one answers, she often say, You should now this. Look it up.

Get over it, not in kindergarten anymore.  She presents the material relatively clearly and concisely.  Slides are not much help when studying, so class attendance is pretty much mandatory.

Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,2,23090786,1,,awesome,5,BIOL4200,"Loved immunology. This class is hard, but then again it is a fourth year course. For me her interest in the subject really drove me forward. She is fair and gives a bonus if you want to do a presentation, not to mention bonuses on midterms and finals. Her slides will tell you all you need to know and make you interested in immunology!",04/24/2014,1.0,1.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,No,1398335479000,N/A,1452,N/A,,A+,[],person,people
