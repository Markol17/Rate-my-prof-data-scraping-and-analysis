Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,36198763,0,online,awesome,5,BIO3360,Didn't have Python experience before this class but Dr. Lefebrve made it super accessible. Charismatic prof who seems to love what he does! Would recommend to anyone looking for an elective that teaches you cool skills. Found lots of applications from the assignments. There's a learning curve after the first lectures but very much worth it!,04/30/2022,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,N/A,1651287066000,Yes,0,Yes,,A+,"['Online Savvy', 'Amazing lectures ', 'Caring']",people,people

Material is mainly recorded and presented asynchronously with a total of 4 assignments. IMO easy class as long as you stay on top of the material.

The course load is a bit heavy (4 assignments + 1 take-home midterm + 1 presentation and paper + 1 take-home final exam) so make sure to keep up with the lectures so you don't fall behind. He explains the material well and he responds to emails quickly.

Weekly labs and it can get to be a lot of work, but easy to do well in the course if you keep up with it. Wish there was more interaction as the course was mostly asynchronous. Synchronous labs were extremely slow and mostly one-sided, TAs and prof didn't take the hint that ppl were very lost",05/06/2021,3.0,3.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1620322905000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A+,[],people,people
