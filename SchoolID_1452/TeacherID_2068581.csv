But my god, lectures consisted of him reading a powerpoint in a super dry and monotone voice. Tried super hard to get the class to engage, just lacked the charisma to encourage it.

He's awesome and will help you get that A. Midterm and exam require a lot of studying but that's normal for any history course.
