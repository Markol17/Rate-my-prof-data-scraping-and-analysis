Mandatory,good,good,good,0,35629095,0,,awesome,5,MAT4995,I loved this class and I'm so glad that I took it. It was a great experience for me since this is the first time in my program that I've had a math professor that made me so interested and passionate about the course material. Professor Broadbent is a great lecturer and she also cares a lot about students. She is the best professor I've ever had.,12/22/2021,5.0,5.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1640149079000,Yes,1452,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Amazing lectures ', 'Inspirational', 'Lots of homework']",people,people

Very responsive to emails as well. Overall great prof. Maybe weightage of individual tests and final exams might bring down your marks a little.
