Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,36346386,0,,average,3,THE3552,"He comes across as pretty timid when he's teaching, which makes the class atmosphere feel a little strange. He does mark relatively easy; if you show up and do the work, you'll likely get a good grade. Grading criteria is not always clear, and feedback is not always helpful. He's knowledgable and a good prof, and he shows respect to students.",05/16/2022,1.0,1.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,0,N/A,1652669384000,Yes,0,Yes,,A+,[],people,people
Not Mandatory,average,poor,average,0,30990904,0,,average,3,THE3552,"Kyle is new to teaching and it shows in his confidence while teaching. Despite being new, he is knowledgeable on the subject. I'll be honest, I skipped a few classes, but over all it didnt make too much of a difference. Im sure if I tried just a little more I wouldve gotten an A. I learnt more about sound and lighting with him than with Jon",12/12/2018,1.0,1.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1544630798000,Yes,1452,Yes,,B+,['Graded by few things'],people,people

Very sassy, but not in a funny way. Lectures are boring and labs are a bit better, but not great.
