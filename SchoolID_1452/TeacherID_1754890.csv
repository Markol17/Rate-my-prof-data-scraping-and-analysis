N/A,average,average,average,0,21223470,0,,average,2,SOC1101,He was pretty average. Hated the group work project. He was SO unclear on expectations. He explained it SO much and still most people misunderstood the actual format of the paper. His textbook is annoying and there's way too much reading. Final exam was BAD. Essay question was way too vague!!!,01/07/2013,3.0,3.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,Yes,1357577968000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
