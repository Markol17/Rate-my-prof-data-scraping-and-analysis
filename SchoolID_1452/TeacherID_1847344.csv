N/A,poor,average,poor,5,22692492,1,,awful,1,ENG1100,Clearly knowledgable but lacks the ability to teach. Oppressive/rude and unnecessarily calls out students. Dismisses questions during class. Lec/DGDS are mandatory as attendance is taken and each DGD has a quiz/worksheet worth marks. Avoid taking the class with this Prof if you can.

She does, however, have some difficulty with personal interactions, often comes across as short, insensitive or rude. As a result the class atmosphere is oppressive and student are afraid to speak up.

Everyone is dead quiet and a bit scared of her. Quick to tell students they shouldn't be there and should just leave.
