She is a very tough grader so you have to work hard for your mark but she does let you know what will be on the final exam ( short & long questions) Lectures are kinda boring and dont have a real flow to them but she does know her material.,01/06/2017,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1483702992000,Yes,1452,Yes,,B-,"['Tough grader', 'Beware of pop quizzes']",people,people
