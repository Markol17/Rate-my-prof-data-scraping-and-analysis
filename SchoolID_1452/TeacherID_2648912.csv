Mandatory,good,average,good,0,33971169,0,online,awesome,5,RUS1901,Prof. Sokoloski is amazing. This is the only class I really enjoyed this semester. He gives a lot of homework and there are a lot of tests but they're really beneficial and he gives great feedback on everything. And he's one of those teachers who you know actually WANTS you to succeed.
