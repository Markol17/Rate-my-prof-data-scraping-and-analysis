Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,35772722,0,online,average,3,APA2301,His lectures digress a lot and he tends to just talk about random things which makes it hard to take notes sometimes. What bothers me though is that he will call on people randomly in the online class and call you out if your camera is not on.

Midterm is easy but the final is a lot tougher and worth 50% so study a lot. The best study tool of all is just focusing and listening in his class.
