I dropped the course before starting as she was rude and condescending in her emails. I have trouble believing she is allowed to teach. Her assignments are not clear but her expectations are very high. AVOID at all costs. Her sections is still open for registration and I am not surprised. All other sections are closed as they are filled. ",05/06/2022,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,0,N/A,1651847594000,N/A,0,Yes,,WD,"['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework']",people,people
