Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,36327224,0,online,awesome,5,ELG2911,The class itself is kinda useless and its very little work if you have a good group to work with. Joseph is probably the best professor to choose for this class because he's very clear about the grading criteria for the assignments & presentation. ,05/13/2022,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,0,N/A,1652405654000,Yes,0,Yes,,A+,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Caring', 'Group projects']",people,people

Lectures were as interesting as they possibly could be given he's talking about engineering accreditation for most of it. Guidelines are vague, but it doesn't seem to matter since they grade leniently. Was very helpful and timely when I emailed him after making a mistake in an assignment.",05/02/2022,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,N/A,1651504765000,Yes,0,Yes,,A+,"['Group projects', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

Not Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,0,33277815,0,,awful,1,CSI2911,Hes very last minute and disorganized. The class itself is an ez A but the prof is so bland and dry its hard to stay awake. He posts critical stuff like outlines at the last minute and yet expects you to get started on your projects way in advance.,05/12/2020,1.0,1.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1589320056000,No,1452,Yes,,A+,"['Group projects', 'Lots of homework']",people,people

Make sure to listen in class, you WILL fall behind if you don't listen (duh) and he occasionally quizzes you at the end of class.  Assignments aren't proof-read, there were a few mistakes and missing information - ask him to clarify.
