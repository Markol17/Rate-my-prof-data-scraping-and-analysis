Mandatory,good,good,good,0,36621175,0,online,awesome,5,ANP1506,"M. Coutu was calm/patient with our questions. I took his class online, he used to go through the slides in 30 mins and then the rest was open for questions. The books is useless (it's all on the slides). For the exams, make sure to know all of the exceptions. For an anatomy prof, I really enjoyed M Coutu, i'd definitely take his class again.
