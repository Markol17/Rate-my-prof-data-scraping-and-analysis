N/A,average,average,average,0,21918241,0,,poor,3,HSS3703,Le cours est un cours d'environnement de base (style secondaire). Le travail de session est relativement facile et l'examen final était ridicule. Il fallait savoir les statistiques par coeur. C'est juste une perte d'argent et de temps car j'ai assisté même pas à la moitié des cours .
