The lecture notes you have to buy are so small and he doesn't post them online due to copyright. Midterms were easy, final was brutal. Do every question in the assignment, even though you hand it in a group. only 4 labs throughout the semester, biomed students like me have 12 extra ones.",01/02/2008,3.0,3.0,,4,Low,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1199291286000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
