His class was interesting enough, but he is extremely concerned with verbatim definitions, and I found his assignments and papers somewhat frustrating. All in all, it wasn't a bad class, though.",12/28/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Low,2.5,2.5,1,No,1451307735000,N/A,1452,Yes,,B+,"['Hilarious', 'Group projects', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people

Disrespectful, told a student her question was stupid. I went to most every class and came out with an A but only after significant effort on my part. Very strict and unrelenting. Few tests, but they are worth a lot so study hard. ",08/11/2015,3.0,3.0,,2,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,1439314472000,N/A,1452,Yes,,A,['Tough grader'],people,people

His midterms and assignments are few but worth a lot so make sure you study like crazy and do the readings.,02/04/2015,3.0,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1423068607000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,[],people,people
