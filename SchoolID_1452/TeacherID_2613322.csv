We had 2 anatomy quizzes, a lab exam, a midterm, a final exam, and a group project with 3 parts. All her exams and quizzes were very fair. Plus, the lab exam and midterm were open book and had no time limit. The labs were really fun too especially the taping ones.

Mandatory,good,average,good,0,36091108,0,,awesome,5,APA3525,Favorite prof I've had so far. Exams are fair and on the actual course material. Wants her students to succeed in every way possible. Will take extra time to explain concepts even though all the information you need to succeed is in her slides.
