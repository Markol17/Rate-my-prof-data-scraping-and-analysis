Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,34180343,0,online,average,3,EAS1101,There was unclarity/inconsistency surrounding grading criteria and assignment requirements; Swapna was always willing to help out via email which I appreciated. Her approach to this course involved a lot of self-reflection; this was also appreciated as it differed from standard history courses.
