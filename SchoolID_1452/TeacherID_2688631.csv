Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,36160545,0,,awesome,5,bio3350,Lectures were shorter than the other profs and her learning objectives were direct. I watched her lectures at 1.75x and had no issue understanding her since the diagrams and text on the slides clearly indicated what she wanted us to know.

Her exam questions were relatively straight-forward so I definitely appreciated that. She also tended to read off the slides so it was boring, but her lecture component itself was again straight-forward and rather easy to understand.

I'm not a native speaker myself but I can understand most accents just fine. Her's however was really hard to decipher. Half the lecture slides I was unsure what she was saying.

Dr Chen did a good job! Her exam questions were very straightforward! It does not take hours to go through a lecture, in fact, her lectures were never the 1h20 min length.
