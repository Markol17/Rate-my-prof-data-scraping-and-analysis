Lectures didn't have much structure, she often went off topic. Rarely got responses from emails. I spent hours every day reading the required books. We read a novel a week, some 100 pgs, others 500 pgs. ",04/30/2022,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,Yes,1651281195000,N/A,0,Yes,,N/A,"['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework']",people,people

She has incredibly lenient due dates, but if you get the work in on time she gives good feedback to help you improve. Lots of participation marks too. Favourite course of the semester by far.
