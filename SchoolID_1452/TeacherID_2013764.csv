She was upfront about this being her first time teaching and seemed to care a lot about the work we were doing for class. Do your homework because she'll call on you but at least doesn't make you feel bad.",09/09/2015,4.0,4.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,No,1441820615000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Participation matters', 'Hilarious', 'Tough grader']",people,people

How to write resumescover lettersmemosagendas, etc: that's basically the entirety of the course. 2 assignments and one exam, not too bad considering it's a simple course. I only wish she would've made clear the criteria for her assignments.",06/25/2015,1.0,1.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,No,1435230926000,N/A,1452,Yes,,A,"['Tough grader', 'Participation matters']",people,person

Tries to be funny in slides, gets old really quickly. Posts all her lectures online. Wastes the last 30 minutes of class sometimes. Only 2 assignments and 1 midterm. Pretty hard grader, not a really hard class though. ",05/11/2015,2.0,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.0,3.0,1,No,1431372697000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,[],people,person
