Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,32491345,0,,good,4,BIO3522,If you get the textbook you don't really need to go to class. I only went to lectures where the stuff being covered wasn't in the textbook (he indicates those classes on the syllabus) and did great. He is a great prof and if it wasn't an 8:30am class I probably would've gone more often. He's funny and engaging and exams are fair ( 2 MT 1 Final),11/29/2019,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1575050601000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Hilarious', 'Caring', 'Amazing lectures ']",people,people

Not Mandatory,good,average,good,1,28821044,1,,awesome,5,BIO3522,He's a great prof. Weekly online quizzes that are just basically grade boosters. He's an easy grade and the material is fairly easy. Attending isn't mandatory but it might help. Didn't buy the textbook and still did well so don't waste your money. He's a really chill and funny prof too so his class was always enjoyable to attend!,11/02/2017,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1509620836000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Gives good feedback', 'Caring', 'Hilarious']",person,person
