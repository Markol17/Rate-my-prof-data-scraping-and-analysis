Mandatory,average,good,average,0,34282694,1,,poor,2,THE1100,His lecture style is pretty laidback and casual and he presents a lot of facts/history. The problem is that assignments and tests do not reflect how he chooses to teach. He doesnt tell people that they need to use abstract thinking to apply concrete concepts without providing examples. He assigns a LOT of plays to watch &amp; read.
