Mandatory,average,average,average,6,24917145,0,,average,2,SYSC3006,Material was interesting but prof didn't seem pleased to be teaching.  Hard to ask questions because the prof will scoff at you if he thinks it's stupid or obvious.  Likes to ask the class questions and will put students on the spot before they have a chance to think.
