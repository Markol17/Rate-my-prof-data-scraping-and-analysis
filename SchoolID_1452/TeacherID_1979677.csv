Maybe it was because project management really interested me. That being said, classes are participative, but sometimes it can be dry. Just sometimes though. Grading criteria not clear at all.

Doesn't care about others people's view, not friendly with disagreement/different opinion, Grades depend of him liking you and zero field experience. Work doesn't count if he doesn't agree with you and give you lame feedbacks and biased to some people.
