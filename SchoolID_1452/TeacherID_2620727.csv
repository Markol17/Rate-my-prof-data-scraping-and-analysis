Was engaging and interesting, really listened to student's answers and integrated them into his lessons instead of looking for something narrow. Was the only class I would look forward to. Certainly not easy projects, but with a group keen on success it is more than do-able.

You don't have to show up, as long as you can have a good understanding of his articles to compose the midterm learning report. As for grading he is honestly very generous, a minimal of B is what you will get as long as you wrote something and had some effort.
