She mainly reads off the slides and posts them online so attendance isn't mandatory, but recommended. Lectures can be boring but the project is very interesting.

On the other hand, her classes are boring, same tone in her voice, isn't really funny.

I was surprised to see that the Professor seemed mostly lost for the first 3 weeks of class, both with her lack of understanding of uOttawa systems, as well as the lack of course material and clarity. Unfortunately, I would not recommend her. She's nice though :) ",02/26/2015,3.0,3.0,,2,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,No,1424911224000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,[],people,person
