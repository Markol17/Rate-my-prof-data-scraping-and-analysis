Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,34585427,0,online,awful,1,ELG2736,Yeah all around pretty bad prof. He got upset at students for not asking questions on demand (he would ask if everything was clear and if you asked him for clarification later he would get mad) I took the class in french and he didn't bother translating any of the labs or homework.

Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,34570725,0,online,awful,1,ELG2137,Prof. Youssef's lectures are difficult to follow and he is often unable to understand his students questions about class content and provide an adequate solution. Self-learning from the textbook is essential for students interested in mastering the course content.
