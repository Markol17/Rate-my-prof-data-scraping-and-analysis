There is something special about Agata's class and the environment she cultivates. She's also very organized, clear and really connects with students.

Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,34700032,0,online,awesome,5,EDU7133,I've taken a LOT of course at Ottawa U by now because I'm at the end of the program and Education in times of crises is by far the best course in the program. It's not easy to get a good grade but the professor actually works with you and gives you feedback to help you do your best work.
