N/A,good,average,good,0,30217249,0,,awesome,5,PSY3307,He made psychometrics as fun as psychometrics could possibly be. It's kind of a boring topic and he understands that. Being a psychometrician himself meant that he knows a lot about the topic and he gives lots of feedback on the data on the midterm and tells you exactly what will be on the midterm and final. I also loved the group project.,05/31/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1527798146000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Hilarious', 'Gives good feedback', 'Respected']",people,people

His psychometrics class is a blast, and he presents everything in a practical, useful way unlike other profs who just ramble on with theory.
