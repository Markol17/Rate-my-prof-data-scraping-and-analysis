N/A,poor,good,poor,0,931154,0,,poor,1,BPS4104,One of the worst classes I have ever taken.  I expected far more from a 4th year class.  You are given NO expectation of what is expected until it is too late (i.e. AFTER assignments or exams are written).  I was given more respect in 1st year classes!,05/06/2003,4.0,4.0,,2,N/A,1.5,1.5,1,N/A,1052230869000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
