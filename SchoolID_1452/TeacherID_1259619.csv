N/A,good,good,good,0,15807052,0,,good,4,PHI2396,Bioethics was a brutal course. The prof is  approachable and explains the theories well. The marking scheme is harsh considering that we're science students and have never written an ethics paper before. There is too much reading - you're expected to read the whole textbook according to the syllabus which is unrealistic.,05/10/2009,5.0,5.0,,4,Low,4.0,4.0,1,No,1241985856000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
