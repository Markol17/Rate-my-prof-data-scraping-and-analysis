Please do consider giving your students questions such as the last ones (on 15 or 10 points) of your midterms before they actually do the midterm and find themselves losing so many points on things they did not specifically see in class. More complicated examples in class would also prepare students better. Merci,12/30/2011,3.0,3.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.0,3.0,1,No,1325278020000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
