Lots of interesting stuff that I wish I had known when I started art school, rather than at the end! He has a weird sense of humour, but at least he is not as boring as some of the other profs!",06/26/2014,2.0,2.0,,4,Low,4.5,4.5,1,No,1403780403000,N/A,1452,N/A,,A,[],people,people

Daniel was fascinating and very capable in explaining the very boring parts (documentation etc) of being a professional artist. He makes good jokes sometimes.
