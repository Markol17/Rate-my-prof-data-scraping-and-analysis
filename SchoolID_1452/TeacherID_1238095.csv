N/A,good,average,good,0,19362669,0,,good,4,MAT1300,I don't know what these people are talking about. He takes a while to get used to but his exams are right out of the book. He really explains calculus easily once you get used to his accent. I've had calc profs who were TERRIBLE -even ones from Poland- this guy is fine and really knows his stuff.,12/02/2011,2.0,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1322835550000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

Explanations are weak, assignments are ambiguous and you will not be prepared for them.  Midterms were reasonable, but the final was ridiculous.  You will carry an A throughout the course, then he nails you big time on the final.  Beware!!!!!!
