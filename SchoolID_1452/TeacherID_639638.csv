One of Telfer's worst teachers without a doubt. The assignments are very long, there is too much information and the students tend to get lost. The exams are very long which leaves us little time to do it even if we understand the course.His course is dated 2018. We don't even have access to our feedback to improve. Avoid, get another teacher.
