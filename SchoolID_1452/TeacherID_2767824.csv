Her course material is not difficult, however her grading is unfair due to the lack of instructions and clarity. She seems to deduct marks if phrases are not specifically how she would word them and is not understanding when asking for revisions.

She makes us read hundreds of pages per week and never does anything with the information in them. She is confused about her own material and makes a lot of mistakes in her slides.
