This course was disorganized, she didn't seemed to know what was going on and relied heavily on blackboard while not knowing how to make it work. Lectures were repetitive and endless ramble of 3-4 ideas. The group project was a mess as well. Introduced course work in the last three days of the EXAM PERIOD.
