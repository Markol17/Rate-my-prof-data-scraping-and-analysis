His lectures are very long, all he does is read the slides word per word and never adds any comments after reading them. The things we learned in class did not go with the course at all. We never even opened the textbook either. I don't recommend this class to anyone",05/01/2016,2.0,2.0,,3,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1462124928000,N/A,1452,N/A,,A+,"['Lecture heavy', 'Beware of pop quizzes']",people,people
