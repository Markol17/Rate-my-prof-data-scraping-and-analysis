She's very informal and treats you like a friend, not like a child like some profs. Overall, this class takes a lot of work, but it's not hard if you are a hard worker and you like the material. Very rewarding class - you come out with great skills.",09/10/2014,2.0,2.0,,5,It's my life,5.0,5.0,1,No,1410359953000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
