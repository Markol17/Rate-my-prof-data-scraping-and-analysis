She gives us 'self-directed' learning, wants us to read the textbook, has a quiz every week, and when you go to her office hours (she actually only lets 15 mins) she provides you with absolutely no help. It is a hard course and she just makes it worse. Also, you can't speed up her recordings and she talks so slow.",11/09/2021,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1636501424000,No,1452,No,,Not sure yet,"['Test heavy', 'Get ready to read', 'Lots of homework']",people,people
