His grading is opaque - he asks for concision, but fails you unless you word vomit everything you know about a topic, doesn't give full marks on tests, sets questions relating to readings that haven't been assigned.

Assignments are ridiculously long, exams are tedious (get prepared to memorize the stats Can website), and the marking is unfair.
