You basically make videos on your own time with very little criteria, so you're just teaching yourself via practice. He just talked for the whole 4 hours, showing some videos, but boring. He was helpful to talk with after class but won't answer emails. He gave no grades all semester! and no feedback on big projects",06/02/2020,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1591073947000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Graded by few things', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people

I really wish we would have had a say in the type of lectures. For example, one person knew and loved VDMX, no one else used it. Thus a 4 hour lecture on it is pointless if the one person already knows, and no one else needs it",01/03/2016,2.0,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,3.5,3.5,1,No,1451818701000,N/A,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Lots of homework', 'Inspirational']",people,people
