Super bright and has great ways of explaining thing if you don't understand, however you NEED to go to office hours. Basically if you don't go to office hours to clear up misunderstandings, you won't pass. Overall, tough class but super rewarding. Ignacio wants you to succeed, but he'll definitely give you a challenge.",04/10/2021,5.0,5.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1618026493000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Test heavy', 'Accessible outside class', 'Caring']",people,people

He has an incredibly hard time transferring his intelligence to the students. His slides are extremely hard to decipher as he doesn't show many derivations or problems. No practice midterm or final either, and 5 examples for both. Class struggled heavily. He means well, though.",12/11/2020,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1607647123000,No,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people
