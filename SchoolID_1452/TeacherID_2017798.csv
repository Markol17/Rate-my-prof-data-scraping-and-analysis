Mandatory,average,average,average,0,27246888,0,,poor,2,FLS2512,He's decent. He is unclear of what he wants his students to do in the course. He can be funny at times but there are times where his class feels like a grade nine french class. There are not many students so his classes are more personal but it is still not the best class I've ever taken. The content is easy though.,11/23/2016,2.0,2.0,,2,N/A,2.0,2.0,1,No,1479897667000,No,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Group projects', 'Participation matters', 'Graded by few things']",people,people
