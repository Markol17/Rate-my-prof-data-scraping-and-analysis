He's hilarious and really wants you to learn! He doesn't use powerpoint which is the best thing ever because it doesn't help you learn the theory. He applies his knowledge hands on, and uses his charm and wit to help you pay attention.

He's new so could work on more thought out lectures and needs stay on top of the syllabus, but that's the only complaint I have.
