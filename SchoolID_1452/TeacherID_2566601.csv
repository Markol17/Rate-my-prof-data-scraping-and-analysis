The first 2 assignments, I had a difficult time, but later for the exam and last assignment I did great and my mark really rose.

He makes the subject so interesting and makes the class laugh all the while. He really wants his students to succeed and does a lot to ensure so. I wish all professors were like him. He could teach any subject and I would take the class!,01/28/2020,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1580217650000,Yes,1452,Yes,,B+,"['Hilarious', 'Caring', 'Amazing lectures ']",people,people
