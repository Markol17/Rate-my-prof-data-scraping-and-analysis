She is nice but can be boring. Overall, it was a decent class and her lack of teaching experience  is made up for with clear criteria and helpful DGDs. The textbook was also good for extra practice but not 100% needed.",06/04/2016,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1465068904000,Yes,1452,Yes,,B+,"['Clear grading criteria', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

They were all fair and she even knocked marks off of the total to help us out. If you're bad at math I wouldn't recommend because she wasn't always clear(french accent) but she was nice and fair.
