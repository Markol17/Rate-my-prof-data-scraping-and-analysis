Not Mandatory,poor,good,poor,1,27335876,0,,awful,1,MAT1739,Probably the worst prof someone could get. Puts all of his notes on Blackboard so no need to go to class since he doesn't say anything new in class. If you ask a question expect him to smile and change the subject cause he doesn't know what he is talking about. Lots of homework  too. Can't wait for this semester to be over so I won't see him again.,12/05/2016,4.0,4.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1480947417000,No,1452,N/A,,B,"['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy']",people,person
