Mandatory,poor,good,poor,2,27320188,0,,awful,1,ESP2992,One of the worst professors I have ever had & actually inspired me to create an account here. She expected way too much of her students & wasn't willing to work with the students when they needed it. She would blame students for failing a test even though the entire class would fail. She didn't actually teach anything. I enjoyed Spanish before her.,12/03/2016,5.0,5.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1480773755000,No,1452,Yes,,WD,"['Test heavy', 'Tough grader']",people,people
