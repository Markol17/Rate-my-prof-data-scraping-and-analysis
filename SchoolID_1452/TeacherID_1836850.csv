Mandatory,good,good,good,2,22760419,0,,good,4,SOC3142,I had her for 3rd year Applied Statistical Analysis. The course itself is hard and she made it much easier on everyone. Smart (and funny!) woman who knows her stuff. Made what could have been very dry lectures about stats more interesting and put people who were nervous about 'doing math' at ease.

I ended up teaching myself by the textbook. not the worst but I do dislike profs that think they are better than everyone. you will see what I mean if you choose her!!",12/22/2013,3.0,3.0,,1,Meh,1.5,1.5,1,Yes,1387747733000,N/A,1452,N/A,,B,[],people,people

Stats is full of dry material, but she adds in her own unique flavour that makes it bearable. She lightens the mood by playing music related to the theme of the lecture before every class. She really bends over backwards to make sure you understand the material. Awesome professor!!!!",11/27/2013,1.0,1.0,,5,Meh,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1385583915000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
