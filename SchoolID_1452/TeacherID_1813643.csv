Exams are exactly as he says they are and there are no surprises. I thought the content itself was a little dry but he made the best of it.

I believe this was his first time teaching a full course, though if he wouldn't have mentioned it, definitely wouldn't have been able to tell. Super helpful in clarifying topics, funny & genuinely concerned for students' success. Lectures were interesting, assignments offered considerable freedom & expectations on exams were very clear.",04/29/2013,2.0,2.0,,5,Really into it,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1367263611000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,person
