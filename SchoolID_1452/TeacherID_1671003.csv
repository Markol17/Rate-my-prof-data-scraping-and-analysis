For his final exams he gives you exactly what you need to know BUT his exam was mainly consisted of memorization of over 30-40 fill in the blanks. I found it was more so an exam consisting of memorization rather than actually understanding the course content.",01/16/2012,2.0,2.0,,4,Sorta interested,4.5,4.5,1,Yes,1326737364000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],person,people

Yes, there was a 320 point exam, but on the last day of class, he made a review that was literally the exact same thing as the exam, all you had to do was memorize and study. The class is really easy if you actually put effort into it.",01/08/2012,1.0,1.0,,3,It's my life,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,1326018374000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
