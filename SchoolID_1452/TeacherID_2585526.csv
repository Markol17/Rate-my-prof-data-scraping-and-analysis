Mandatory,good,poor,good,0,33066055,0,,awesome,5,ILA1901,Sam is the best! The class was elementary Algonquin language learning and definitely the most fun I've had in a uni course so far. She uses a lot of visuals and oral reinforcement which makes it easy to learn (as long as you practice!) I would suggest making flashcards for this course and doing them on your commute to school,04/15/2020,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1586978306000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A+,"['Participation matters', 'Hilarious']",people,people
