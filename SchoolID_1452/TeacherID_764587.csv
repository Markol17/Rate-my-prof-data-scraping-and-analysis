Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,23086958,0,,average,3,APA3125,She's a great prof- knows her stuff and always has interesting stories to tell from her own experiences in the field! You really need to be an independent studier though because there's a ton more that you have to know than what is discussed in class. Very fair with marks. The final was a pain because of the amount of information! Buy the textbook!,04/23/2014,3.0,3.0,,3,Really into it,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1398280839000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
