Her powerpoints were very well built and she always allowed for discussion in class. Skimming the readings and then paying closer attention to the ones needed for assignments was enough.

Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,33596904,0,,awful,1,FEM1100,Awful! Her class is badly organised has too many TAs. Most of the time you do not know who graded your paper. there is no clear grading scheme. Grading by her so by her TAs is subjective. Gives celebrities as examples for feminists who are far from being a feminist. she gives a celebrity example after each class. alot of pointless howrk and papers.,08/19/2020,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1597800541000,No,1452,Yes,,B+,['Lots of homework'],people,people
