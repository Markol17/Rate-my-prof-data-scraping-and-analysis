Not Mandatory,poor,poor,poor,0,35295435,0,online,awful,1,MUS2704,There is no class you attend. The professor shares PowerPoints and that's literally it. If you want free credits go ahead but if you actually want to learn something about music it is a waste of time. Horrible course for online learning. The teacher aspect is completely missing and who would want to pay for college if you just watch PowerPoints.,11/24/2021,1.0,1.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,No,1637715638000,No,1452,No,,N/A,['Graded by few things'],people,people

He brings in props and stuff like guitars and effects, and the lectures are interesting looks into pop and rock culture throughout the decades. There is a lot of cool listening to music in class, and as a prof he is really nice. I would definitely take his classes again, he's dope",10/16/2018,2.0,2.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1539705536000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Amazing lectures ', 'Inspirational', 'Caring']",people,people
