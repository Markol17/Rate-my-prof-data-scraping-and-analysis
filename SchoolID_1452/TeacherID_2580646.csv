Uploads all readings online for free. They are long and confusing but he's great at breaking them down in class. Attendance not mandatory, but I would not have understood the concepts had I only read the slides. Great prof!!",03/29/2020,4.0,4.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1585497345000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Hilarious', 'Clear grading criteria']",people,people
