N/A,average,good,average,0,33715948,0,online,poor,2,NUT1504,Im very surprised with the comments posted for this professor. Hes extremely disorganized and often posts lectures late. This makes it difficult for students with a heavy course load to plan adequately. The questions on his quizzes are also difficult or ambiguous and he often tests on material that has not been studied.
