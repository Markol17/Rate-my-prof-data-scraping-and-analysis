I thought abolition was going to be a tough course but the way he explained the material made it super easy. Class consisted of 2 essays and a take home, along with 3 discussion board questions and 2 outlines. Gives good feedback and is an easy marker!

N/A,good,average,good,0,35678167,0,online,awesome,5,CRM4302,This is by far one of my favourite professors I've had at uOttawa. He really tries to make the distance learning engaging and interesting and encourages discussion on the content that makes you think from a different perspective. Super accessible outside of class and his feedback on the three essays we had was sooo helpful for improving my papers,12/30/2021,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1640894649000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['So many papers', 'Gives good feedback', 'Caring']",people,people
