The midterm was definitely harder than the final and the last two assignments were hard to follow even with lecture notes, but it definitely worked out in the end. She curved for the class in the end and she submitted grades before showing us, but it worked ok.",04/30/2022,2.0,2.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,N/A,1651291082000,Yes,0,Yes,,A-,[],people,people

Although her lecturing is very slow, if you ask her for something she will help you with it. Honestly the course is hard itself, you end up understanding things with the assignments, helping eachother is key in this class because yes content is hard.

Her notes seem confusing but if you attend the lectures it all falls into place. She explains things so well and her assignments closely follow what is taught in class. She is so nice and answers questions well. Only downside is she talks VERY slow but I watch after @ x2,03/28/2022,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,No,1648473458000,Yes,1452,Yes,,Not sure yet,"['Gives good feedback', 'Inspirational', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people
