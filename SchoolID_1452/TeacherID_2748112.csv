Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,35743066,0,online,awesome,5,APA2302,Fantastic professor! He made lecture content that I didn't find particularly interesting so engaging! He is very clear about expectations and is helpful both in and outside of class. I would say that though attendance is not mandatory you get so much more from his class if you do attend.

N/A,good,average,good,0,35545049,0,,awesome,5,APA2302,Where to start... Professor Chipman is by far the best prof I've ever had. He makes every lesson super interesting and tries to make it interactive too. He answers his emails super quickly and truly makes you feel at ease. He also cares about your mental health and always reminds us to take it easy.
