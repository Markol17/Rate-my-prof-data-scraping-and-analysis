Not Mandatory,good,average,good,0,35702248,0,,good,4,GNG1106,Professor Soleimani is a great professor. The lectures might be a bit long and dragged but she does help by showing many demonstrations. Class structure is pretty good because this class mostly depended on assignments and improving coding skills through the assignments rather than large tests and exams. Great way to learn coding with no experience.,01/05/2022,2.0,2.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1641362280000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Accessible outside class', 'EXTRA CREDIT', 'Lots of homework']",people,people
