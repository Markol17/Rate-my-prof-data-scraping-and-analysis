The take home is also pretty tough, however if you show up to class and do the readings you'll be fine.",12/08/2016,4.0,4.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1481203211000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Get ready to read', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

When this guy gives his lectures, he doesn't appear to be remotely enthused by the subject matter (on which he did his PhD).
