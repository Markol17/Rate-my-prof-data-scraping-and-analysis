Mandatory,good,good,good,0,30614999,0,,good,4,3121D,"Overall, I enjoyed her class! It can be difficult to take notes because she speaks quickly and the majority of the information is not on the slides but she is always willing to repeat any information you may have missed. She gives great hints on what will be on the midterms and final. You have options (reflections or term paper) which is great!",10/26/2018,4.0,4.0,,4,N/A,4.0,4.0,1,No,1540552446000,Yes,1452,Yes,,A,"['Gives good feedback', 'Clear grading criteria', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people

She wants her students to pass and I really enjoyed her 7-10 classes. She's also a history teacher, so get ready to write a lot of notes. She gives you the chance to write reflections every 2 weeks to raise your grade or do a final paper.

To be fair, she taught this class for the first time. Provides slides that are not very useful, talks quite fast which makes it hard to take adequate notes. Four reflections (4x5%), paper+template (30%+10%), final (40%). Good prepping for the final.",01/14/2017,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,No,1484392013000,No,1452,N/A,,A,"['Caring', 'Accessible outside class', 'Tough grader']",people,people

Doesn't put most of the material on the slides to make sure you show up to class. Reflections in lieu of a midterm, but ridiculously difficultly graded. Paper was long but not too difficult.
