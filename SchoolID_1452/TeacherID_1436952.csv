N/A,average,average,poor,0,17507897,0,,poor,2,MUS3111,Class's topics were interesting but not the teaching. Slides were not elaborated on. Information was common sense and the class turned more into piano pedagogy than Music Education. Assignments weren't what we did in class at all. Would not take this again or recommend it.,08/12/2010,2.0,2.0,,1,Sorta interested,1.5,1.5,1,No,1281655314000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people

The worst part was her lecture was powerpoint slides which were also posted on Virtual Campus. There was actually no reason to go to class because she never really elborated beyond the slides. She has A LOT of degrees, but she can't teach well.",04/26/2010,3.0,3.0,,3,Really into it,2.5,2.5,1,No,1272297768000,N/A,1452,N/A,,N/A,[],people,people
