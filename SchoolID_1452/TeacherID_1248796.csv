N/A,good,good,good,0,24002611,0,,good,4,WRIT100,I'm personally not a fan of English but I enjoyed having Keith. He is a tough marker and has high expectations when it comes to papers. I think it's because he's pretty clear with the criteria he's looking for. He's really into participation so speak up if you know the answer to his question.
