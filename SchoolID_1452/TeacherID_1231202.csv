The class was supposed to be taught in English but half the times it feels like you're sitting in a French class. Lectures are very disorganized and concepts covered are not clear or left ambiguous.

People disrespectfully talked over her though. Seems interested in the subject and likes teaching. Gave a easy 10% extra on a midterm if you wrote a small reflection.
