The answer is when you ask a question, he sets you up with all the information to answer the question yourself, and then he pauses, and lets you answer it. He lets you have the &quot;Ohhhhh moment,&quot; and you feel like a genius",04/08/2021,3.0,3.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,Yes,1617922883000,Yes,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Caring', 'Amazing lectures ', 'Accessible outside class']",people,people

I took Tax because it sounded useful, but I expected it to be as fun as eating cardboard. But surprisingly, he made it engaging and interesting. MacGregor goes the extra mile answering questions.

He often chooses students to read a case and do presentations about the case instead of him lecture, then engages with the class about the case. Interesting and entertaining lectures.
