Not Mandatory,good,poor,good,2,36052535,0,online,awesome,5,MUS1302,"Professor Laroche's class is super amazing. He will teach you everything about Jazz Music, and you may have a chance to sing in his class. The grading system is super easy: complete quizzes and you're good to go. Read all his materials and try to sing it by yourself, then you will definitely get an A+.

Highly recommend this professor!!!",04/11/2022,1.0,1.0,,5,N/A,5.0,5.0,1,N/A,1649647403000,Yes,0,Yes,,A+,"['Amazing lectures ', 'Clear grading criteria', 'Gives good feedback']",people,people
