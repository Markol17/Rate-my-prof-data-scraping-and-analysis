Mandatory,average,average,average,0,33389981,0,,average,3,PSY3171,Sweet woman and very nice however hard to stay focused during a 7-10. Often when people had questions she told us to look in the book. Very monotone and quiet. She had nice personal stories and really interesting guest lecturers but lectures themselves fell flat. She is a fair grader. Tests are multiple choice short answer and diagnostic questions.,05/30/2020,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1590842595000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Get ready to read', 'Lecture heavy']",people,people
Not Mandatory,average,average,average,0,33036059,0,,average,3,PSY3173,Super interesting class but it HEAVILY relies on the textbook so the lectures were quite boring because it was basically a recap of the textbook chapter. She tried incorporating group exercises which was good. I dropped out after the first midterm but the test was pretty hard. Religiously study the textbook and you should be good,04/08/2020,3.0,3.0,,3,N/A,3.0,3.0,1,Yes,1586380815000,No,1452,Yes,,N/A,"['Lecture heavy', 'Get ready to read']",people,people
