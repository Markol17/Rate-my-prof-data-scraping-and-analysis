Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,2,30339357,0,,awful,1,ADM2352,"I believe he may be better teaching something besides Finance. For a course so specific and detailed, that requires proper explanations and examples, you won't get much out of him. It is also hard at times to understand what he is saying. I did this course through self teaching and just reading the textbook honestly. That's what you'll have to do",07/12/2018,3.0,3.0,,1,N/A,1.0,1.0,1,Yes,1531389214000,No,1452,Yes,,A-,"['Group projects', 'Lecture heavy', 'Get ready to read']",people,people

The prof seems to be lack of availability for students and presentation skills for the materials he is teaching. Attending his lectures might not be helpful since he just basically goes through slides. However, I believe he has a good personality.
